            <p>
              Single page web application build using Rails and Backbone.js.
              This application offers many of the features that are central
              to fantasy football applications, such as adding, dropping, and
              trading players, or setting lineups.

            <p>
              Gravity based game written in JavaScript using the canvas API.
              Moving objects in the game are influenced by the gravitational
              fields of all other objects in the game using a model of gravity
              that follows the law of inverse squares.

              rails. Active lite provides something something I'm still not
              sure how to describe this.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <ul class="about-me">
          <li>
            I'm a software engineer looking for opportunities to work in the
            San Francisco Bay Area as a web developer. I am experience in Ruby
            on Rails, Javascript, and Backbone.js.

            Recently, I moved to San Francisco from Berlin, Germany in order to
            get into the industry. I'm excited about coding and building great
            things.
